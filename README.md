# ECE300 Communication Theory

This repository contains MATLAB coursework for **ECE300: Communication Theory** at The Cooper Union.

---

## Course Overview

Communication systems fundamentals covering signal representations, noise, modulation, and detection. The course emphasizes probabilistic modeling and performance analysis (e.g., SNR, BER) and uses MATLAB to simulate channel impairment, modulation/demodulation chains, and receiver decision rules.

---

## Topics

- Signals and spectra for communications; bandwidth and power tradeoffs
- Noise and random processes; AWGN channel model
- Linear modulation: AM/DSB/SSB (concepts) and coherent detection
- Angle modulation: FM/PM fundamentals
- Baseband digital modulation: PAM, ASK, PSK, QAM
- Matched filtering and optimum detection in AWGN
- Symbol error rate / bit error rate analysis and simulation
- Sampling, pulse shaping, ISI, and basic equalization concepts
- Link budgets and SNR-based performance metrics
- MATLAB-based end-to-end simulation and verification
