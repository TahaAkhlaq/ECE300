# ECE211 Signal Processing

This repository contains MATLAB coursework for **ECE211: Signal Processing** at The Cooper Union.

---

## Course Overview

Signal processing fundamentals for continuous-time and discrete-time signals and systems, with emphasis on analysis in time and transform domains and practical implementation in MATLAB. Core tools include Fourier analysis, Laplace and z-transforms, frequency response, convolution, and representation of LTI systems via poles and zeros.

## Topics

- Signal representation and classification; energy and power signals
- LTI systems: impulse response, convolution, eigenfunctions, frequency response
- Fourier series and Fourier transform; spectra and filtering intuition
- Laplace transform; transfer functions, poles/zeros, stability, transient response
- Sampling and reconstruction concepts; aliasing and spectral replication
- Discrete-time analysis: z-transform, DTFT, difference equations
- Modulation concepts and spectral translation basics (signal mixing viewpoint)
- Random signals and noise fundamentals (introductory treatment)
- MATLAB-based analysis, simulation, and verification
